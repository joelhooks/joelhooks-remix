My friend Alex Hillman introduced me to the concept of tummling[^1] and it has been something I've strived to be better at since I learned about it. Alex believes that we shouldn't try to be "community managers" instead we should work on being really good tummlers for our communities ❤️

Here's a great talk from Amy Gold on the topic of being a great tummler:

<div style=" position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding-top: 56.25%; margin-botton: 2em">

<iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1Y7wi7BaXw" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>
